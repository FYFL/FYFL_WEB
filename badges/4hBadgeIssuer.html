 <h2>4-H Badge Issuer</h2></div>

<p>
      The badge issuer uses an Open Badge Infrastructure (OBI) developed by Mozilla to accommodate requests for badges and then send them to the earner’s backpack or displayer.  The badge itself is an image file representing the subject and criteria associated with the badge.  The system imbeds metadata into the image that leads to more information.  Upon clicking of the image a page is opened that shows details associated with the badge; who it was issued to, date, issuer or approver, criteria associated with earning the badge, etc.
</p> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  The 4-H Badging Infrastructure will use the Mozilla Open Badge Infrastructure (OBI) in a way that protects the privacy and security of young learners but also allowing for earned badges to reside in the Mozilla Backpack (badge displayer) upon request of learners 13 or older.
</p>
<h3>Why Issue Badges?</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li>
		Extend the value of learning experiences – allowing young learners the flexibility of pursuing multiple learning pathways.</li> <br/>
<li>
		Promote the 4-H brand – badges can be shared across the entire Mozilla badges ecosystem extending the brand and its values along with them.</li> <br/>
<li>
		Builds the 4-H community – Each 4-H badge links back to 4-H regardless of where they are shared or used.  More people can discover 4-H learning experiences through badges.</li> <br/>
<li>
		Promote 4-H success on a bigger stage – Badges represent real learning experiences and achievements fostered by 4-H. The Mozilla OBI allows 4-H to share evidence of these successes to individual earners and across a broader ecosystem – across the world!</li>
</ul>
