    <h1>Welcome to the 4-H Digital Badge system! </h1>
    <p><b>NOTE: The local and state 4-H program must register with this site before it can be used by youth, parents, or adult volunteers in 4-H. Any other user registration would be as a General User and would not have acces to 4-H Badges.</b></p>
    
    <p></p>
    <p>This website is designed to provide a safe and secure environment for children and youth to earn badges through 4-H. The process requires local 4-H staff to register in the system and serve as a moderator for digital badges in their county. Local volunteer leaders in 4-H will work with local 4-H staff to issue badges to young people involved in their club, group or project. Young people ages 13 and older will simply register as a user. Children under the age of 13 will register with their parent's or guardian's assistance and persmission. To begin, choose the link below that fits you best.</p>
    <h2>User Levels</h2>
    <p><a href="resgistration_staff.html">Local 4-H Agent, Extension Employee, or University Faculty</a></p>
     <p><a href="registration_vol.html">Volunteer Leader or Teacher involved with or interested in 4-H</a></p>
       <p><a href="registration_parents.html">Parent or Guardian of Child under age 13 who is interested in earning badges in 4-H</a></p>
         <p><a href="registration_child.php">Child or young person interested in earning digital badges in 4-H</a></p>
    <p>It is important that the local 4-H extension staff begin to prepare for using the 4-H Digital Badge site. If your state or county has not begun to use the site it will be necessary to have someone at the state level of 4-H contact the 4-H Digital Badge support team at:</p>
