    <p></p>
    <p>If you have a child under the age of 13 interested in 4-H digital badges then the following information is important to you. According to the Child Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA) you must give permission for your child to register as a user in the 4-H Digital Badge System. The registration process requires that you register as a user first and then complete or assist with your child's registration.


</p>

    <p>Also, the 4-H Digital Badge System is under continuing improvement. User input is important and users are invited to participate in a short survey. Please click on the link below to see information about the survey as a Parent of a child who may be asked to respond.</p>
     <p><a href="#">4-H Digital Badge Survey - Parental Approval </a>     - Instructions about the survey will be provided as you continue into the system.</p>
       <p>Continue to <a href="#">Create an Account</a> to complete registration. You will select the Create New Account tab and begin. Once you have completed the registration form and pressed submit a message will be sent to your e-mail address welcoming you to the system. An administrator of the system will confirm and activitate your registration as an approved Parent at which time you will receive a second message about completing your registration. You will follow the link in that message to confirm your account and set your password. At that point you can begin to use the system.</p>
