    <p id="padding"><b>NOTE: The local and state 4-H program must register with this site before it can be used by youth, parents, or adult volunteers in 4-H. Any other user registration would be as a General User and would not have access to 4-H Badges.</b></p>
    
    <p></p>
    <p id="padding">This website is designed to provide a safe and secure environment for children and youth to earn badges through 4-H. The process requires local 4-H staff to register in the system and serve as a moderator for digital badges in their county. Local volunteer leaders in 4-H will work with local 4-H staff to issue badges to young people involved in their club, group or project. Young people ages 13 and older will simply register as a user. Children under the age of 13 will register with their parent's or guardian's assistance and permission. To begin, choose the link below that fits you best.</p>

         <p id="padding"><a href="#regChild">Child or young person interested in earning digital badges in 4-H</a></p>
    <p id="padding">It is important that the local 4-H extension staff begin to prepare for using the 4-H Digital Badge site. If your state or county has not begun to use the site it will be necessary to have someone at the state level of 4-H contact the 4-H Digital Badge support team at:</p>

    <p></p>
    <p id="padding">If you are a local 4-H employee interested in beginning to use the 4-H Digital Badge system for a local county level 4-H program, please follow the steps listed below. The 4-H Digital Badge support team will assist each state and county in using the site through state and local level contacts.</p>
 <div >
 <p id="padding"> <ul id="padding"><dl>
<li ><dt>IMPORTANT:  Contact the 4-H Digital Badges Support Team and let them know your state wants to begin using the site.</dt></li>
<dd>- A state level contact must be identified and then register with the site.</dd>
<dd>- The State 4-H Badges Contact will then be activated or approved by the System Administrator of the 4-H Digital Badge System.</dd>
<li><dt>Once the State 4-H Badges Contact is authorized local 4-H staff should register</dt></li>
<dd>- State level contacts will authorize Local 4-H Badges Contacts</dd>
<li><dt>Once Local 4-H Badges Contacts are authorized Local Adult Volunteer Leaders should register.</dt></li>
<dd>- Local 4-H Badges Contacts will authorize volunteer leaders to operate within the system.</dd>
</dl></ul></p>
 </div>
     <p id="padding">NOTE: Local approval of a volunteer leader is critical as this step assures that adult users have appropriate permissions to interact with young people in their club, group or project. Approval by the local staff is done according to state 4-H volunteer guidelines and procedures.</a></p>
       <p id="padding">Following the steps outlined above will make the process of getting local volunteer leaders and youth started in the 4-H Digital Badge System much smoother. As Volunteer Leaders register the local 4-H Contact will be notified via e-mail and respond accordingly to approve the leader.  If you recieve a registration notice from a user you do not know, please verify who they are before approving them. Again, this is critical in that your authorization indicates that the adult user is authorized to interact with young people in your 4-H program.  Registering users before these steps may result in some delay in ability to use the system.</p>

    <p id="padding">NOTE: When youth under the age of 13 register the process will involve their parent or guardian. You will receive e-mail notices that parents or guardians have registered. Parents and guardians will confirm that their child has permission to use the system.</p>
    <p id="padding">NOTE: When youth age 13 or older register the Local 4-H Contact will receive a notification that they have registered.</p>
        <p id="padding">Local 4-H Badges Contacts will only recieve notifcations of user registrations within their assigned county and approve of those users accordingly.</p>
