 <h2>4-H Badge Earner</h2></div>
 	
	<div id="geninfo">

        <p>
Earning a badge through 4-H will be associated with learning experiences that follow a set of criteria determined by established project or curriculum material; clearly delineated learning experiences associated with a program supported by 4-H; or other criteria identified as evidence of knowledge, understanding, skills and capacity to apply their learning regarding any given subject.  Some level of rigor will be determined for any given badge or set of badges that must be met for the badge earner to receive the badge.  Using the 4-H Badging Infrastructure, badge earners may accept, store, and manage their badges within a “backpack” or portfolio through which they can be displayed for others to see.  Various options will be available to the badge earner to display their badges on a variety of sites including blogs, social media sites, and personal websites.
<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> The 4-H Badging Infrastructure defaults to private to protect young learners later allowing an interface with the Mozilla OBI and Backpack.

 <h3 style="text-align:left;"> Why Earn Badges?</h3>

<ul type="disc"><li>
		<strong>Tells a more complete story. </strong><br />
		By combining multiple badges in the Backpack, one can share a more comprehensive story of skills and learning history to potential employers, schools, and peer groups.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Control of credentials. </strong><br />
		The 4-H badge system allows complete control over badges.  One can accept and reject badges as well as set privacy controls. </li>
<li>
		<strong>Promotion. </strong><br />
		One can organize their badges in groups that can be shared with different audiences allowing the earner to manage accomplishments and showcase them.</li>
</ul>
